## ⭐ [Overview](#top)

`BB-Import` is the most critical element of my Bash-Bits Modular Bash Library.

With `BB-Import`, you can make ANY code file which is accessible via a URL a part of your own script or application, and the software will automatically cache a local copy so that you aren't having to constantly download it from the internet.  And what's more - the next version of `BB-Import` will even make sure you've always got either the latest, or your specified version of that file, ready to go, whenever you need it.
